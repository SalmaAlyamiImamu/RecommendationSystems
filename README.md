# RecommendationSystems
This repository contains all implemented codes, including data preprocessing and feature engineering, as well as recommender systems (RS), a classical RS based on matrix factorization (MF) and a neural RS based on multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with ReLU non-linear activation function. In the proposed RSs, I introduced 4 implicit features to assist the RS and enhance recommendation quality. I also have included programs' side information namely: program’s class, program’s genre, and program’s quality (HD) to the RS. The incorporation of items’ side information to the implicit interactions alleviates the cold start problem and add high personalization and interpretation to the model.
